# pedCrossingSim

This project models a mid-block pedestrian crossing and studies how signalization of the crossing and changes to the wait time for pedestrians affects both vehicles and pedestrians.

The underlying model is the NaSch Cellular Automata which was created in the early 1990s by German physicists Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg.
